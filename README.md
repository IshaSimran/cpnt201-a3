I created this logo by making a drawing on procreate on my ipad. I exported it as a jpeg and opened it in figma and traced it using the pen tool to create 4 separate closed paths. Lastly uploaded to svg-omg and optimized it. This logo was made in mind for a potential client with a cosmetic tattooing business or freelance makeup-artist business.
